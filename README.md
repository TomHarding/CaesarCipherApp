# Caesar Cipher App

Caesar cipher is a monoalphabetic substitution cipher. It takes a string and shifts all the characters by a given offset.

This application allows you to encrypt and decrypt that cipher. It just takes a string and shift offset and does the rest.

This really offers no encryption in todayâ€™s world, as it's easily broken or even brute forced, but it's a nice beginning into cryptography.
