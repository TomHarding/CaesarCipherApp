# Ceaser Cipher App

Just a small forms application to encrypt/decrypt text using a monoalphabetic substitution cipher.

It takes the string and converts it to a ASCII byte array and then shifts all the characters by x. This offers
no real value in encryption terms today, but it's a nice beginning into cryptograpthy.
